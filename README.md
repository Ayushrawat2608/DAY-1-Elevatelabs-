This project showcases my data cleaning and preprocessing skills using Microsoft Excel. The raw dataset was collected from Kaggle, and I performed the following tasks:

Removed duplicate and repetitive entries using Excel tools.

Handled and filled missing/null values appropriately.

Applied Excel formulas to perform various calculations and derive useful insights.

Ensured the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis or visualization.


This repository demonstrates how powerful Excel can be for initial data preparation before moving to advanced tools lik Power BI
